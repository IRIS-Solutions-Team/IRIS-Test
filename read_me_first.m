%% Simple SPBC Model // Read Me First
% by Jaromir Benes
%
% This tutorial is a collection of example files for a simple sticky-price
% business cycle model (SPBC). The model file and m-files included in the
% tutorial describe a typical workflow in building and operating a
% small-scale DSGE models for practical policy analysis and forecasting.
%

%% How to Best Run This Tutorial?
%
% Each m-file in this tutorial is split into what is called "code sections"
% in Matlab. A code cell is a shorter block of code performing a specific
% task, separated from other code cells by a double percent sign, `%%`
% (usually with a title and brief introduction added). By default, the
% cells are visually separated from each other by a horizontal rule in the
% Matlab editor.
%
% Instead of running each m-file from the command window, or executing this
% `read_me_first` as a whole, do the following. Open one tutorial m-file in
% the Matlab editor. Arrange the editor window and the command window next
% to each other so that you can see both of them at the same time. Then run
% the m-file cell by cell. This will help you watch closely what exactly
% is going on.
%
% To execute one particular cell, place the cursor in that cell (the
% respective block of code will get highlighted), and select "Run Current
% Section" from a contextual menu (upon a right click on the mouse), or
% pressing a keyboard shortcut (which differ on different systems and
% Matlab versions). To learn more on code sections, search Matlab
% documentation for "code section".

%% Simple Sticky Price Business Cycle Model File
%
% This is a model file for a simple sticky-price business model. The model
% file describes variables, parameters and equations. Note that the model
% file does not specifies the tasks that will be performed with the model.
% The tasks will be set up in separate m-files, using standard Matlab
% functions and IRIS functions.
%
% You cannot run the model file itself. Instead, load the file into Matlab
% using the function |model| function. See the m-file |read_model| for more
% details.
%
% The IRIS model files can be syntax-highlighted in the Matlab editor; this
% makes the files easier to read. To this end, associate the model file
% extension(s) (which can be anything) with the editor. Open the menu File
% - Preferences, and click on the Editor/Debuger - Language tab. Use the
% Add button in the File extensions section to add new extensions, e.g.
% 'model'. Then restart the editor, and that's it.

%% Read and Solve Model
%
% Create a model object by loading the model file `Simple_SPBC.model`,
% assign parameters to the model object, find its steady state, and compute
% the first-order accurate solution. The model object is then saved to a
% mat file, and ready for further experiments.

% edit read_model.m;
read_model;

%% Get Information About Model Object
%
% Use the function `get` (and a few others) to access various pieces of
% information about the model and its properties, such as variable names,
% parameter values, equations, lag structure, or the model eigenvalues. Two
% related topics are furthermore covered in separate files:
% assigning/changing parameters and steady-state values, and accessing
% model solution matrices.

% edit get_info_about_model.m;
get_info_about_model;

%% Assign and Change Parameters and Steady States
%
% Assign or change the values of parameters and/or steady states of
% variables in a model object using a number of different ways. Under
% different circumstances, different methods of assigning parameters may be
% more convenient (but they, of course, all do the same job).

% edit change_parameters_and_sstates.m;
change_parameters_and_sstates;

%% Model Solution Matrices
%
% Describe and retrieve the state-space form of a solved model. IRIS uses a
% state-space form with two modifications. First, the state-space system is
% transformed so that the transition matrix is upper triangular
% (quasi-triangular). Second, the effect of future anticipated shocks can
% be directly computed upon request, and added to the system stored in the
% model object.

% edit know_all_about_solution.m;

%% Find and Describe Balanced Growth Path
%
% The SPBC.model is a BGP model: It does not have a stationary long run.
% Instead, it has two unit roots, introduced through the productivity
% process, and the general nominal price level. To deal with BGP models,
% there is absolutely no need to stationarise them. They can be worked with
% directly in their non-stationary forms.

%% Simulate Simple Shock Responses
%
% Simulate a simple shock both as deviations from control and in full
% levels, and report the simulation results.

% edit simulate_simple_shock.m;
simulate_simple_shock;

%% More Complex Simulation Experiments
%
% Simulate the differences between anticipated and unanticipated future
% shocks, run experiments with temporarily exogenised variables, and show
% how easy it is to examine simulations with mutliple different
% parameterisations.

% edit simulate_complex_shocks.m;
simulate_complex_shocks;

%% Simulate Permanent Change in Inflation Target
%
% Simulate a permanent change in the inflation target, calculate the
% sacrifice ratio, and run a simple parameter sensitivity exercise using
% model objects with multiple parameterizations.

% edit simulate_disinflation.m;
simulate_disinflation;

%% Monte-Carlo Stochatic Simulations
%
% Draw random time series from the model distribution, and compare their
% sample properties against the unconditional model-implied models. Keep in
% mind that this is a purely simulation exercise, and no observed data
% whatsoever are involved.

% edit resample_from_model.m;
resample_from_model;

%% Import CSV Data Files and Prepare Data
%
% Load basic data from CSV data files into databases where each series is
% represented by a tseries (time series) object. Prepare the data to be
% used later with the model: seasonally adjust, convert to quaterly
% periodicity, and create model-consistent variable names.

% edit read_data.m;
read_data;

%% Simulate Fisher Info Matrix and Test Parameter Identification
%
% Calculate estimates of the Fisher information matrix. The Fisher matrix
% is a property of the model itself, and is independent of any data. It
% represents the maximum amount of information one can hope for to find in
% the data in case the data are really generated by the model DGP.
%
% Compare two approaches: a time-domain approach, and a frequency-domain
% approach. Use the singular value decomposition to learn more about which
% parameters (or combinations of them) are identified the best or the
% worst.

% edit fisher_information_matrix.m;
fisher_information_matrix;

%% Run Bayesian Parameter Estimation
%
% Use bayesian methods to estimate some of the parameters. First, set up
% our priors about the individual parameters, and locate the posterior
% mode. Then, run a posterior simulator (adaptive random-walk Metropolis)
% to obtain the whole distributions of the parameters.

% edit estimate_params.m;
estimate_params;

%% Posterior Simulator with 'saveEvery=' Option
%
% In this file, we show two features of convenience when running larger
% posterior simulations. First, the posterior simulator can be run with the
% option `'saveEvery='` to split the simulated posterior chain into smaller
% bits and saving them each in a separate data file. This is a way to get
% around possible out-of-memory problems when simulating larger models
% and/or longer chains. Second, a large posterior simulation can executed
% incrementally in smaller chunks, with the final state of one simulation
% being used as the initial state for the next one.

%% Kalman Filtering and Historical Simulations
%
% Run the Kalman filter on the historical data to back out unobservable
% variables (such as the productivity process) and shocks, and perform a
% number of analytical exercises that help understand the inner workings of
% the model.

% edit filter_hist_data.m;
filter_hist_data;

%% More on Kalman Filter
%
% Run more advanced Kalman filter exercises. Split the data sample into two
% sub-samples, and pass information from one to the other. Run the filter
% with time-varying std deviations of some shocks. Evaluate the likelihood
% function and the contributions of individual time periods to the overall
% likelihood.

% edit more_on_kalman_filter.m;
more_on_kalman_filter;

%% Forecasts with Judgmental Adjustments
%
% Use the Kalman filtered data as the starting point for forecasts, both
% unconditional and conditional, i.e. with various types of judgmental
% adjustments.

% edit forecasts_with_judgment.m;
forecasts_with_judgment;

%% Compare Second Moment Properties in Model and Data
%
% Compute and compare several second-moment properties of the estimated
% model and the data. Describe the data using an estimated VAR; this also
% allows to evaluate sampling uncertainty of the empirical estimates using
% bootstrap methods.
