%% Calculate and Describe Balanced Growth Path
%
% The SPBC.model is a BGP model: It does not have a stationary long run.
% Instead, it has two unit roots, introduced through the productivity
% process, and the general nominal price level. To deal with BGP models, 
% there is absolutely no need to stationarise them. They can be worked with
% directly in their non-stationary forms.

%% Compute Two Different Points on BGP
%
% Compute two different points on the BGP corresponding to two different
% levels of productivity, `A`. The resulting steady-state levels of other
% varibles are always in constant proportion to the level of `A` (here,
% they simply double). The steady-state growth rates remain, obviously,
% unchanged. Whenever some variables are fixed in `sstate( )`, the steady
% state must be solved for non-recursively, i.e. with `Blocks=false`; this
% is the default setting, and can be therefore omitted.

% They give the same solution. Illustrate this fact here by comparing the
% covariance matrices of the model variables, and a shock simulation.
