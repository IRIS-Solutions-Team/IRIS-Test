## IRIS Tutorial: Simple SPBC Model                                        

In this tutorial, we build a simple sticky-price business-cycle model
(SPBC), and run a number of basic and more advanced experiments to
illustrate typical tasks in practical model development and operation.
The experiments include, for instance, steady-state comparative statics,
dynamic simulations, estimation, filtering of historical data, and
forecasting.
